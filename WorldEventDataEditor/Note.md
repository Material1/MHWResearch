This tool is nowhere near complete since it turned out we can't actually use the tss file to host permanent custom quests due to CAPCPOM whitelisting the event quest IDs in the game executable. 

Feel free to use it to dump and preserve the event quest data though.

Major credits to v00d00y for reverse-engineering the encryption and a lot of the structure.
